# AppMesh

Desktop automation through application mesh networking - the modern successor to ARexx.

## What It Does

Enables Claude Code and scripts to control desktop applications via D-Bus and OSC protocols. Your computer becomes a mesh of cooperating programs orchestrated through natural language.

## Architecture

MCP server with protocol plugins:
- **D-Bus plugin**: Clipboard, notifications, screenshots, window management
- **OSC plugin**: Ardour DAW, Carla plugin host control

## Current Tools

**D-Bus (8 tools):** clipboard get/set, notify, screenshot, dbus_call, dbus_list, kwin window list/activate

**OSC (3 tools):** generic send, Ardour control, Carla control

## Running

```bash
# MCP server (auto-loaded by Claude Code)
php server/appmesh-mcp.php

# Web UI
php -S localhost:8420 -t web/
```
